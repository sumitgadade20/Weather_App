# Weather_App
This is a basic weather web app built usiHTML, CSS, and  JavaScript (with fetch API). The app fetches real-time weather data from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays information such as temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the current condition.
